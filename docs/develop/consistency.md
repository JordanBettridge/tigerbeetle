# Consistency

TigerBeetle is designed to guard against bugs not only in its [own
code](https://github.com/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle/blob/main/docs/TIGER_STYLE.md), but at the
boundaries, in the application code which interfaces with TigerBeetle. This is exhibited by the
client's API design, which may be surprising (see [Retries](#retries)) when contrasted with a more
conventional database.

Strict consistency guarantees (at the database level) simplify 1) application logic and 2) error
handling farther up the stack.

## Guarantees

TigerBeetle provides strict serializability ([serializability +
linearizability](http://www.bailis.org/blog/linearizability-versus-serializability/)) to each
[client session](./client-sessions.md).

But consistency models can seem arcane. What specific guarantees does TigerBeetle provide to
applications?

#### [Sessions](./client-sessions.md)

- A client session may have at most one in-flight [request](./client-requests.md).
- A client session [reads its own writes](https://jepsen.io/consistency/models/read-your-writes),
  meaning that read operations that happen after a given write operation will observe the effects of
  the write.
- A client session observes writes in the order that they occur on the cluster.
- A client session observes [`debits_posted`](../reference/accounts.md#debits_posted) and
  [`credits_posted`](../reference/accounts.md#credits_posted) as monotonically increasing. That is,
  a client session will never see `credits_posted` or `debits_posted` decrease.
- A client session never observes uncommitted updates.
- A client session never observes a broken invariant (e.g.
  [`flags.credits_must_not_exceed_debits`](../reference/accounts.md#flagscredits_must_not_exceed_debits)
  or [`flags.linked`](../reference/transfers.md#flagslinked)).
- Multiple client sessions may receive replies [out of order](#reply-order) relative to one another.
  For example, if two clients submit requests around the same time, the client whose request is
  committed first might receive the reply later.
- A client session can consider a request executed when it receives a reply for the request.

#### [Requests](./client-requests.md)

> Note that a request refers to a batch, rather than a single event.

- A request executes within the cluster at most once.
- Requests do not [time out](#retries). Clients will continuously retry requests until they receive
  a reply from the cluster. This is because in the case of a network partition, a lack of response
  from the cluster could either indicate that the request was dropped before it was processed or
  that the reply was dropped after the request was processed. Note that individual [pending
  transfers](./two-phase-transfers.md) within a request may have
  [timeouts](../reference/transfers.md#timeout).
- Requests retried by their original client session receive identical replies.
- Requests retried by a different client (same request body, different session) may receive
  [different replies](#consistency-with-foreign-databases).
- Events within a request are executed in sequence. The effects of a given event are observable when
  the next event within that request is applied.
- Events within a request do not interleave with events from other requests.
- All events within a request batch are committed, or none are. Note that this does not mean that
  all of the events in a batch will succeed, or that all will fail. Events succeed or fail
  independently unless they are explicitly [linked](./client-requests.md#linked-events)

#### [Events](../reference/operations/index.md)

- Once committed, an event will always be committed — the cluster's state never backtracks.
- Within a cluster, object [timestamps are unique and strictly
  increasing](./time.md#timestamps-are-totally-ordered). No two objects within the same cluster will
  have the same timestamp. Furthermore, the order of the timestamps indicates the order in which the
  objects were committed.
- If a client session is terminated and restarts, it is guaranteed to see the effects of updates for
  which the corresponding reply was received prior to termination.
- If a client session is terminated and restarts, it is _not_ guaranteed to see the effects of
  updates for which the corresponding reply was _not_ received prior to the restart. Those updates
  may occur at any point in the future, or never. Handling application crash recovery safely
  requires [using `id`s to idempotently retry events](#consistency-with-foreign-databases).

#### [Accounts](../reference/accounts.md)

- Accounts are immutable. They are never modified once they are successfully created (excluding
  balance fields, which are modified by transfers).
- There is at most one `Account` with a particular [`id`](../reference/accounts.md#id).
- The sum of all accounts' [`debits_pending`](../reference/accounts.md#debits_pending) equals the
  sum of all accounts' [`credits_pending`](../reference/accounts.md#credits_pending).
- The sum of all accounts' [`debits_posted`](../reference/accounts.md#debits_posted) equals the sum
  of all accounts' [`credits_posted`](../reference/accounts.md#credits_posted).

#### [Transfers](../reference/transfers.md)

- Transfers are immutable. They are never modified once they are successfully created.
- There is at most one `Transfer` with a particular [`id`](../reference/transfers.md#id).
- A [pending transfer](./two-phase-transfers.md#reserve-funds-pending-transfer) resolves at most
  once.
- Transfer [timeouts](../reference/transfers.md#timeout) are deterministic, driven by the [cluster's
  timestamp](./time.md#why-tigerbeetle-manages-timestamps).

### Reply Order

Replies to a client session always arrive in order — a client session may have only one request
in-flight, and clients ignore (duplicate) replies to their prior requests.

- Requests are executed in the order they arrive at the cluster's primary.
- Replies to different clients may arrive out of order.

#### Example

Consider two clients `A` and `B`:

1. Client `A` sends request `A₁`.
2. Client `B` sends request `B₁`.

Client `A` sent its request first, but requests `A₁` and `B₁` may execute in either order —
whichever arrives first at the primary will execute first.

In this diagram, the requests are delivered out of order — `B₁` then `A₁`:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client A
    participant Client B
    participant (Network)
    participant Cluster
    Client A->>(Network): A₁ (request)
    Client B->>(Network): B₁ (request)
    Note over (Network): Request A₁ is delayed by the network.
    (Network)->>Cluster: B₁ (request)
    (Network)->>Cluster: A₁ (request)
    Cluster->>(Network): B₁ (reply)
    Cluster->>(Network): A₁ (reply)
    (Network)->>Client B: B₁(reply)
    (Network)->>Client A: A₁ (reply)
```

Suppose instead `A₁` arrives and executes before `B₁`. The replies may be delivered in the same
order (`A₁` then `B₁`), or they may be reordered, as shown below:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    autonumber
    participant Client A
    participant Client B
    participant (Network)
    participant Cluster
    Client A->>(Network): A₁ (request)
    Client B->>(Network): B₁ (request)
    (Network)->>Cluster: A₁ (request)
    (Network)->>Cluster: B₁ (request)
    Cluster->>(Network): A₁ (reply)
    Cluster->>(Network): B₁ (reply)
    Note over (Network): Reply A₁ is delayed by the network.
    (Network)->>Client B: B₁(reply)
    (Network)->>Client A: A₁ (reply)
```

### Retries

A [client session](./client-sessions.md) will automatically retry a request until either:

- the client receives a corresponding reply from the cluster, or
- the client is terminated.

Unlike most database or RPC clients:

- the TigerBeetle client will never time out
- the TigerBeetle client has no retry limits
- the TigerBeetle client does not surface network errors

With TigerBeetle's strict consistency model, surfacing these errors at the client/application level
would be misleading. An error would imply that a request did not execute, when that is not known:

- A request delayed by the network could execute after its timeout.
- A reply delayed by the network could execute before its timeout.

### Consistency with Foreign Databases

TigerBeetle objects may correspond to objects in a foreign data store (e.g. another DBMS). Keeping
multiple data stores consistent (in sync) is subtle in the context of application process faults.

Object creation events are idempotent, but only the first attempt will return
[`.ok`](../reference/operations/create_transfers.md#ok), while all successive identical attempts
return [`.exists`](../reference/operations/create_transfers.md#exists). The client may crash after
creating the object, but before receiving the `.ok` reply. Because the session resets, neither that
client nor any others will see the object's corresponding `.ok` result.

Therefore, to recover to the correct state after a crash, an application that synchronizes updates
between multiple data stores must treat `.exists` as equivalent to `.ok`.

#### Example

Suppose that an application creates users within Postgres, and for each user a corresponding
`Account` in the TigerBeetle cluster.

This scenario depicts the typical case:

1. _Application_: Create user `U₁` in Postgres with `U₁.account_id = A₁` and `U₁.account_exists =
false`.
2. _Application_: Send "create account" request `A₁` to the cluster.
3. _Cluster_: Create `A₁`; reply `ok`.
4. _Application_: Receive reply `A₁: ok` from the cluster.
5. _Application_: Set `U₁.account_exists = true`.

But suppose the application crashes and restarts immediately after sending its request (step 2):

1. _Application_: Create user `U₁` in Postgres with `U₁.account_id = A₁` and `U₁.account_exists =
false`.
2. _Application_: Send "create account" request `A₁` to the cluster.
3. _Application_: Crash. Restart.
4. _Cluster_: Create `A₁`; reply `ok` — but the application session has reset, so this reply never
   reaches the application.
5. _Application_: Send "create account" request `A₁` to the cluster. The request uses the same ID
   as in step 1.
6. _Cluster_: Create `A₁`; reply `exists`.
7. _Application_: Receive reply `A₁: exists` from the cluster.
8. _Application_: Set `U₁.account_exists = true`.

In the second case, the application observes that the account is created by receiving `.exists`
(step 6) instead of `.ok`.

Note that the retry (step 5) reused the same account `id` from the original request (step 2). We
recommend using the same `id`, as opposed to generating a new one for each "create account" attempt,
to avoid leaving orphaned accounts in TigerBeetle if the application were to restart before
receiving the `.ok` code.
